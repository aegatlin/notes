# Research

Similar to my [uncategorized notes](uncategorized.md), this is where I'll collect my notes about broader fields of technology, as opposed to notes on specific tools or specific systems. When sufficiently mature, subsections can turn into their own pages.

### Thoughts

The gaming industry is essentially exclusively dialogue trees, which are really directed graphs of arbitrary complexity. There are attempts to create logical dialogue systems, and by logical, I mean, having state machine "agents" that employ a semantic network to deterministically say logically coherent things that are not literally scripted. The state of these systems is unclear at time of this writing. The more popular option is using ML/NLP AI, e.g., the game aidungeon uses GPT-3 as of this writing. Further exploration is required to understand what is able to be leveraged.

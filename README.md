# Notes

modular personal remote setup script

The notes are in the [wiki](https://github.com/aegatlin/notes/wiki) (https://github.com/aegatlin/notes/wiki).

The wiki repo is independent of this repo. To edit the wiki you will need to clone that repo specifically: `git clone https://github.com/aegatlin/notes.wiki.git`.

## Setup

To run the setup script from anywhere, run the following command:

Pick your install:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aegatlin/notes/master/setup.sh)"
```

This setup script aims to be universal. It is idempotent, simple, and small.

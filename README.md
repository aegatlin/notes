# Notes

This is a repository of personal tech notes. Visit [notes.gatlin.io](https://notes.gatlin.io) to view via the beautiful [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/) UI.

I am currently exploring Roam Research, and so this is quasi-deprecated for the moment while I write new notes in Roam. I'm not sure if I really want to full sail switch to Roam, so for now it is a trial run.
